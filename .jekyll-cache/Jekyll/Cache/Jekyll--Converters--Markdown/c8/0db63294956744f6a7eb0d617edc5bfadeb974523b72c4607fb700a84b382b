I"ð<p>Simply Jekyll is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to ðŸ˜…). It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>

<p>The theme provides a rich set of features that include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.</li>
  <li>Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.</li>
  <li>Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.</li>
  <li>Auto stale-link management for internal links.</li>
  <li>Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.</li>
  <li>Support for partial transclusion of posts.</li>
  <li>On hover page preview.</li>
  <li>Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.</li>
  <li>Preliminary support for flashcards.</li>
  <li>Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).</li>
  <li>Support for external link identifier through icons.</li>
  <li>Finally, the most important of them all â€” No bloatware or frameworks!</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.</p>

<p>Neat stuff, isn't it? To see the above mentioned features in action go check out the next post. :P</p>
